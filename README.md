*We participated in this challenge in June,2024. This hackathon Based on the Machine Learning.
Our Team secured First rank in Round 1 and third rank in round 2 having 74% accuracy among all IIT's and IIM's participants.*

# So in this hackathon, we used several approches,:-
* Multiple features creation from the use additional datasets.
* Feature Selection: By using Lasso or L1 regularization we found best 12 features
* Meta Learning : By using Base learner models we find the best feature 2 pair features by finding their coefficient. So that we can store their embeddings
* Dimensional Reduction: By using of it we got 10 important features from 12 features.
* Using Boosting Algorithm along With GridSearchCv for Hyper Parameter Tunning , We got awesome results
